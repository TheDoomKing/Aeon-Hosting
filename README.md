# Aeon Hosting Database

This was a small student project created by Amar Zlojic, Arman Ossi Loko and Salih Agic a few years ago in MS Access while we were learning the very database basics. The point was to create a very simple database with a simple UI that would've been managed by a "hosting company", hypothetically named "Aeon Hosting". The project used Basic for some of its implementation

## How to use

The easy way is to simply open the `.accdb` file via MS Access and directly open the main form: `frm_Login`. There are a few test users already included with a lot of dummy data generated by Amar Zlojic. An admin user has the username and password both set to `root`, so the admin panel can easily be accessed using those.

Few of the main forms include a section to add and modify games (their info and preview banner), profile and purchased content preview along with a customizable form background as well as a menu that slides in on click.
